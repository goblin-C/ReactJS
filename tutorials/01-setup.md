# 1. Setting Up Your Project

Welcome to the first step! We're going to get your project ready. It's like preparing your workshop before building something cool.

## What You Need

- A computer with Node.js and npm installed. Think of these as your main tools.

## Step 1: Get the Code

First, you need to have the project files. If you haven't already, download and unzip the project folder.

## Step 2: Open Your Workshop (The Terminal)

Open your terminal or command prompt. This is where you'll type in commands to get things done. Navigate into your project folder like this:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project/react-milestone-5-master
```

## Step 3: Install the Parts (Dependencies)

Your project needs a bunch of smaller tools and parts to work. These are called "dependencies." You can install them all with one command:

```bash
npm install
```

This might take a minute. It's like unpacking all your new tools and organizing them.

## Step 4: Start Your Engine! (Run the App)

Now for the fun part! Let's see the project in action. Run this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`. You should see the website!

**Congratulations!** You've successfully set up your project. In the next tutorial, we'll start building the first piece: the Header.
